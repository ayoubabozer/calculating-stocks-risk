# Decision Tree Classification in Python
This is a project is using decision tree algorithm, which is one of the many Machine Learning algorithms.

Classification: given input data, it is class A or class B?
In this project we will visualize a decision tree using the Python module pydotplus and the module graphviz.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
 - Docker
 
 ### Installing
 
 1. Copy the project to your machine
 
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/ayoubabozer/Python-Decision-Tree-Classification.git
     ```
 
 2. Get into the Dir 
     ```
     cd Python-Decision-Tree-Classification
     ```
    
 3. Build Docker
 
    ```
     docker build -t <tag_name> .
    ```
    
    don't forget the dot.
 
 4. Run
 
     ```
        docker run -ti <tag_name>
     ```
     
     -ti : to make sure that it runs in interactive mode with the terminal attached.
    


### Running and testing
- The program will ask you some question, and will predict if you are a Man or a Woman.

- The program will output the decision tree algorithm, in a file called `tree.png` in your directory.

# ENJOY!.
